# Password Strength Checker 🔐

A C++ program to evaluate password security based on length, character diversity, and entropy. Uses regex, hashing (SHA-256), and string manipulation to determine strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong).

## 🚀 Features
✔ Checks password complexity (Weak, Moderate, Strong)  
✔ Uses **regex** for character diversity  
✔ Calculates **entropy** for security analysis  
✔ Implements **SHA-256 hashing** (Optional for security)  
✔ Simple & Efficient  

## 🛠 Requirements
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- OpenSSL (for SHA-256 hashing)

## 🎯 Usage
1. **Clone the repository**
